# **🚀 Assignment: Careers Page Builder**

### **A. The Assignment 🧠**

Companies using our ATS want their **Careers page** to match their brand, tell their story, and make it effortless for candidates to discover and apply to open roles — especially on mobile.

You’ll build a small product that helps **Recruiters** create branded Careers pages for their company — and lets **Candidates** browse open roles from those pages.

#### ⏰Timeline

You can finish this in **\~6–8 focused hours. The 7-day** window is flexible to let you work at your own pace.

#### 💡Inspiration

Before you start, explore how some companies tell their story:

1. [https://apply.workable.com/careers/\#jobs](https://apply.workable.com/careers/#jobs)  
2. [https://apply.workable.com/gbg](https://apply.workable.com/gbg)  
3. [https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/adtucon](https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/adtucon)

Notice how each page feels **on-brand, simple, and easy to browse** — that’s the kind of experience your product should help **Recruiters** build for their companies.

#### **👥**Who Uses It

| User | What they do | Page URLs |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Recruiter** | Logs in, customizes their company’s Careers page, and shares it publicly | `/login, /company-slug/edit`, `/company-slug/preview` |
| **Candidate** | Reads about the company and explores open jobs | `/<company-slug>/careers` |
| **You (ATS Platform)** | Build the system that allows many companies to manage their own Careers pages | — |

#### **🧩** What You’ll Build

Recruiters should be able to:

* Set brand theme (colors, banner, logo, culture video).  
* Add, remove, or reorder content sections like *About Us*, *Life at Company*, etc.  
* Preview how the page will look before publishing.  
* Save settings — each company’s data stored separately.  
* Share their company’s public Careers link.

👉 *Focus on helping recruiters easily build and customize their company Careers page — with clear, usable controls.*

Candidates can:

* Learn about the company through the Careers page.  
* Browse open jobs with filters (Location, Job Type) and search by Job Title.  
* Experience a clean, mobile-friendly, and accessible UI (labels, contrast, keyboard focus).  
* See an SEO-ready page (crawlable HTML, meta tags, structured data).

👉 *You don’t need to build the job application flow — just the browsing experience.*

#### **📂** Sample Data

### **B. What is expected from you?** 🤔

#### **✅** Submission Checklist

Keep everything **clear, concise, and easy to follow.**

* **GitHub repo** with working code and sample data  
  * **Production live link** (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.)  
  * **Tech Spec.md** — assumptions, architecture, schema, and test plan. DON’T Write this with AI.  
  * **README.md** — how to run, what you built, improvement plan, and step-by-step user guide DON’T Write this with AI.  
  * **AGENT\_LOG.md** — Short notes on how you used AI tools, e.g., prompts, refinements, and learnings. (DON’T Write this with AI.  
  * **Demo video (≤5 min)** — short walkthrough of your app

#### **📤** How to Submit

Once your assignment is complete, please submit your links through the official Whitecarrot submission portal:

👉 [**Open Submission Portal**](https://app.whitecarrot.io/profile-builder/role/96afa3a5-71b7-48ab-aabc-0087b00a595c/user/guest)

Enter your **email address**, then fill in the following details:

* **GitHub Repository Link** – with working code and sample data  
* **Production Live Link** – your deployed app (Vercel, Netlify, Render, etc.)  
* **Demo Video Link** – a short walkthrough (≤ 5 minutes)

Double-check that all your links are **publicly accessible** before submitting.

### **C. Bonus Guidelines** 💰

💡 **Use your imagination** — there’s no single “right” answer here. You’re free to approach the problem your own way, make assumptions, and design a solution that feels practical, scalable, and delightful to use.

Use **AI tools at every phase** — for brainstorming, UI design, and coding.  
Show us *how you worked with AI*, where it helped, and how you improved its output.

Write **clean, maintainable code following best practices** — your next interview will include a short live deep-dive into your code, where you may fix or enhance something.

Focus on delivering a **working, usable prototype** that feels cohesive and complete — something you’d confidently demo to a real customer.

##### 💭 Key Design Questions

* How will you store data for each company separately?  
* How can recruiters easily build and customize their page?  
* How will edits safely update the page?  
* How can candidates browse jobs smoothly?  
* How does your design adapt across devices?  
* How would you scale if hundreds of companies used it?

Use any stack you prefer. Leverage **design, prototyping, and AI-powered dev tools** to move faster.  You can use free-tier platforms like Supabase or Neon.tech for your database.

##### 🚀 Final Note

We care more about how you think than how perfect your code is — so take creative risks, experiment, and show us how you’d build in the real world.

 **Build something you’d proudly demo. Good luck\! 🚀**
